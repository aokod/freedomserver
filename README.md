## freedomserver
Also known as TotalFreedomMod for Cuberite.  Adds basic freedom server functionality to a Cuberite server in order to offer a freedom server that can take the heat!

Based on Steven Lawson and Jerom van der Sar's Total Freedom Mod for Bukkit.  It does not share any source code with that plugin.

Ongoing project.

### How does it work?
This plugin uses Cuberite's integrated permissions system in order to establish an operator role which people can be added to or removed from at the whim of an administrator.  There will be two ranks above the basic operator role: Super Admin and Senior Admin.  Because of Cuberite's ability to store permissions, this plugin should not conflict with others like it.
